# # Ex 2 — Tool-calling supervisor
#
# **Goal:** build a supervisor that routes tickets to 3 specialists using the
# **April 2026 LangChain-recommended tool-calling pattern** — simpler than the
# dedicated `langgraph-supervisor` library wrapper.
#
# **Time:** 30 minutes.
#
# **Why this pattern:** LangChain's multi-agent guidance (April 2026) recommends
# building the supervisor as a tool-calling LLM directly rather than using the
# dedicated library wrapper. You get full control over context engineering,
# specialists become tools, and you stay close to the primitives.

# ## CHALLENGE
#
# Add a 4th specialist `escalation_specialist` that runs when the ticket contains
# profanity or the phrase "cancel my account". Extend the supervisor prompt to
# route to it.
